/**
 * @brief Module that provides the timer service for the 802.15.4 driver.
 *
 * There are two main features of this module.
 * - @b timer allowing scheduling further action to happen. Object of type
 *   @ref nrf_802154_sl_timer_t (and related functions) is responsible for this feature.
 *
 * - @b timestamper allowing timestamping of hardware events occuring in peripherals.
 *   Object of type @ref nrf_802154_sl_timestamper_t (and related functions) is
 *   responsible for this feature.
 *
 * There are two time resolutions available:
 * - @b coarse with resolution of 1/32768 s
 * - @b fine with resolution of 1 microsecond.
 *
 * Fine resolution time service requires a hardware fine resolution timer to be started which can
 * increase power consumption. The fine resolution timer is started on demand
 * by timestampers or software fine resolution timers. The fine resolution timer is stopped
 * when no timestmpers and no timers require fine resolution anymore.
 *
 * This module levarages concept of binding hardware events to hardware tasks. When event is
 * bound to a task the event may trigger the task automaticaly by the hardware. To make
 * such binding hardware PPI/DPPI channels, hardware EGU channels and/or hardware timer
 * capture/compare channels may be used according to API defined by nrf_802154_sl_bet.h module.
 * Binding is performed automatically by the implementation of timer module.
